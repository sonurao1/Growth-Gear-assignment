# Data Query Dashboard Prototype

This is a React app I made for the **Frontend Engineering Intern Assignment**. It’s a dashboard where you type queries, see past queries, and get a chart with fake data. It has a cool futuristic style—dark theme, neon lights, and animations.

## What It Does
- Lets you type queries with suggestions.
- Shows a bar chart with fake data.
- Keeps a list of old queries.

## How I Built It
- **Tools**:
  - React.js (made with Vite)
  - Redux (to handle data)
  - Tailwind CSS (for the futuristic look)
  - Recharts (for the chart)
- **Features**:
  - Type a query, get suggestions, submit it. Empty queries show an error.
  - Past queries show up in a list.
  - Submit shows “Loading”, then a chart.
- **Style**: Dark with neon glow, glass effects, and smooth moves.
